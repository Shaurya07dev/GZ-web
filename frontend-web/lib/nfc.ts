//
// The tag has three states, and the first two are not the end of the story:
//
//   unlinked          no chip recorded
//   linked, unlocked  a chip was written and recorded, but anyone with a phone could rewrite it,
//                     and the piece can't be dispatched until it is locked
//   linked, locked    the chip is read-only for good
//
// A browser can write a chip but cannot lock one (Web NFC has no raw commands), so the
// lock is always finished in the mobile app. Kept dependency-free: no React, no http.
