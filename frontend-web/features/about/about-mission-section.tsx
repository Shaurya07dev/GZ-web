// Verbatim from the source document ("Gz Mission.pdf") — only "Galleryzone"
// was normalized to "GalleryZone" to match this site's brand spelling
// everywhere else; wording, sentences, and the bullet list are unchanged,
// not paraphrased or reordered. Distinct from AboutOverviewSection's short
// "protect the artist's price" mission blurb, which is separate marketing
// copy, not this statement.

// Split into two columns along the document's own seam: paragraphs 1-5 are
// the founding/origin narrative (left), paragraph 6 is the direct lead-in
// to "We strive to:" in the source, so it opens the right column with the
// commitments list and closing lines, exactly as the document orders them.
