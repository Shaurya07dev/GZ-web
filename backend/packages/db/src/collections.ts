// Firestore collection layout — replaces the Drizzle schema/*.ts files
// from the Postgres version. Every collection name + document shape a
// module in this package writes to or reads from is declared here once,
// so the mapping between "what plan.md's data model calls a table" and
// "what Firestore actually calls a collection" stays in one reviewable
// place, the same job schema/*.ts did before.
//
// Design notes carried over from the Postgres schema (see git history for
// the original, fuller comments per field if you need the "why"):
//   - Money is still BIGINT-equivalent: plain `number` in paise, never a
//     float rupee amount.
//   - Append-only collections (statusEvents, ledgerEntries, auditLog) are
//     enforced by firestore.rules (`allow write: if false` for clients) +
//     this package never issuing an update/delete against them itself —
//     there's no DB-level trigger to fall back on the way Postgres's
//     CONSTRAINT TRIGGER was, so this convention is the whole guarantee.
//     Treat any code that updates a doc in one of these collections as a
//     bug. ownershipEvents is the one exception: a transfer is one doc
//     whose status moves pending -> accepted | cancelled (ownership.ts is
//     the only writer, via transferStateMachine); once settled it is
//     immutable, and it is never deleted.
//   - artistPricePaise lives in a `pricing` subcollection under each
//     artwork doc, never on the artwork doc itself — see firestore.rules'
//     own comment on why.
